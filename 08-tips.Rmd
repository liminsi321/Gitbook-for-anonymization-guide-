# Practical considerations {#tips}

Anonymisation affect the utility of the data, where in some case the data become useless for reuse.  Therefore, it should be clearly documented in the metadata of the dataset whether anonymisation has been performed.

Create a key file (a de-anonymisation key) of all removals, replacements, aggregations or generalisations made. Store such a key file securely and separately from your data files (reference).
