# Research Data Types and Pseudonymisation and Anonymisation Techniques {#techniques}

The pseudonymisation and anonymisation techniques vary depending on the types and nature of the data. This guide will discuss the techniques for the following types of research data: **textual data**, **numerical data**, **audio and visual data**, and **geospatial data**.

To see which techniques are most suitable for your data, it is helpful to first see what you want to anonymize. Based on the approach of [UK Data services](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/learning-hub/research-data-management/anonymisation/anonymisation-step-by-step/){target="_blank"}, you can follow these 3 steps to deindentify your data. 
Step 1. Know your data: What kind of research data type do you have? What kind of data do you want to anonymize or pseudonimyze? Do you have textual data or numerical? Or do you have interview recordings consisting of audio?

Step 2. Identify your identifiers in your data: Looking at your data, what kind of identifiers do you see? What kind of identifiers do you want to anonymize or pseudonymize? Do you have names, places, year of birth etc? Are there combinations of identifiers in your data that can identify a person? Or are there isolated incidences or unique events in your data that are easy to identify, for example a rare disease in a neighbourhood.

Step 3.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#install.packages("flextable")
library(flextable)

#create the dataframe for the tabel 
anonymization_steps <-
  data.frame(
    Steps = c("1. Know your data","2. Implement anonymisation techniques","3. Assess disclosure risk"),
    Questions = c("For different types of idetifiers, see [Personal data](#personal_data)","Ensure all dirct and indirect indentifers are removed","Ensure all dirct and indirect indentifers are removed"),
    Examples = c("What kind of data do you want to anonymize or pseudonimyze, such as textual, numertical, audio, video data?","Any remaining information in the dataset still sensitive, or unique?","Are there isolated incidences or unique events in your data that are easy to identify, for example a rare disease in a neighbourhood?"),
    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Create a flextable with customized styling
gradient_colors <- colorRampPalette(c("#007BFF", "#FD62AD"))(n = 3)  # Generates 6 colors between blue and pink
set_flextable_defaults(font.family = "Arial", font.size = 10, padding = 2)
ft <- flextable(anonymization_steps) %>%
  set_caption("Anonymization steps and practical questions") %>%
  set_header_labels(Steps = "Anonymization steps", Questions = "Relevant questions", 
                    Examples = "Examples") %>%
  valign(valign = "center", part = "header") %>% 
  theme_vanilla() %>%
  #font(size = 12, part = "header")%>%
  bold(i = 1, part = "header")%>%
  bg(part = "header", bg = gradient_colors)
# Additional table styling and alignment
ft <- ft %>%
  align(align = "center", part = "all") %>%  # Center-align the content in all parts
  align(align = "left", j = "Steps", part = "all") %>%  # Left-align the "Steps" column
  autofit(add_w = .1, unit = "cm")  # Adjust column widths automatically
# Display the flextable
ft
