# Audio-Visual data  {#audio_visual}

Audio-visual data include various forms of multimedia content, such as video and audio recordings, including voices and visual components. In research, these types of data often capture interviews, workshops, focus groups, places, or any other form of communication with research participants involving their voices and/or images. This section outlines some of the techniques used to anonymise audio-visual data. 

**Voice transformation/distortion **

This technique involves disguising voices such as altering the pitch in a recording. Keep in mind that transforming or distorting the voice can alter acoustic characteristics, which decreases the usefulness of the data. Therefore, the decision to modify sounds should be made based on your research objectives.  

**Image blurring, pixelation or obscuring** 

Video images or pictures of places or individuals can be blurred or pixilated to reduce the level of detail in an entire image or part of an image or picture, which makes it harder to identify a person, place or object, etc. 

This technique involves reducing the level of detail in entire or part of images, making it harder to identify for example a person, location, licence plate, private spaces etc. For instance, you can pixelate the face of a person. See Figure 13 for an example.

```{r blurred_face,fig.align='center',fig.width=10, fig.height=7, out.width="80%", echo=FALSE}
  knitr::include_graphics("figure/blurred_face.jpg") 
```

**Simpel distortion** of the audio or imagery can **only prevent idetnfication** based on the speaker's voice or iamge but it **cannot remove other idetnfiying information** that might exist in the recoding, such as speaking patterns or the mentioned personal information.

## Mute or bleep out the identifying information

In audio or video recordings, you can also mute, remove or bleep out identifying information to anonymise the audio-visual data. For example, you can mute, remove or bleep out identifiers such as names, places, or other information. Please see Figure 14 below, where the personal name has been muted in the audio recording.

```

**Software that can be used for audio-visual data**

There are various software and tools that can be used to anonymise audio visual data. The following are some examples:  

  •	For **audio data**: audio editing software such as **Audacity** can be used to transform or distort the voice or bleep out personal information.

  •	For **video data**: video editing software such as **Adobe Premiere** can be used to blur or pixelate video recordings or transform, distort or bleep out information in the audio recording.

  • For **images**: image editor tools such as **Adobe Photoshop** and **Paint** can be used to blur, pixelate or obscure faces or personal information in pictures and images.
