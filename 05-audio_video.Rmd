# Audio-Visual data  {#audio_visual}

Audio-visual data includes various forms of multimedia content, such as videos, movies, and audio recordings, including voices and visual components. In research, these forms of data capture interviews, workshops and any other form of communication with research participants involving their voices and/or images. Anonymizing these types of data involves modifying the audio, video or images. This section outlines some of the techniques used.

Keep in mind that using these techniques can take a lot of time or are expenstive to conduct.</div>

## Voice transformation/distortion

This technique involves disguising voices such as altering the pitch in a recording. Keep in mind that transforming or distorting the voice can reduce the usefulness of the data. Therefore, the decision to modify sounds should be made based on your research objectives. 

## Blurring, pixelation or obscuring

Blurring by pixelating specific regions of a video image or a picture, such as faces, can effectively anonymize individuals. This technique involves reducing the level of detail in those areas, making it harder to identify the person. In addition, you can also obscure the face of a person. See Image XX for an example of pixelating a face.

```{r blurred_face,fig.align='center',fig.width=10, fig.height=7, out.width="80%", echo=FALSE}
  knitr::include_graphics("figure/blurred_face.jpg") 
```

**Simpel distortion** of the audio or imagery can **only prevent idetnfication** based on the speaker's voice or iamge but it **cannot remove other idetnfiying information** that might exist in the recoding, such as speaking patterns or the mentioned personal information.

## Mute or bleep out the identifying information

In audio or video recordings, you can also mute, remove or bleep out identifying information to anonymize the audio-visual data. For example, you can mute, remove or bleep out identifiers such as names, places or other information. Please see image XX below, where the personal name has been muted in the audio recording.

```{r mute,fig.align='center',fig.width=10, fig.height=7, out.width="80%", echo=FALSE}
  knitr::include_graphics("figure/mute.png") 
```

**Software for audio-visual data**

  •	For **audio data**: audio editing software such as **Audacity** can be used to transform or distort the voice or bleep out personal information.

  •	For **video data**: video editing software such as **Adobe Premiere** can be used to blur or pixelate video recordings or transform, distort or bleep out information in the audio recording.

  • For **images**: image editor tools such as **Adobe Photoshop** and **Paint** can be used to blur, pixelate or obscure faces or personal information in pictures and images.
