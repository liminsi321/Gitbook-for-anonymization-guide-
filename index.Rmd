In today's data-driven world, privacy concerns have become paramount. With the increasing collection of personal data in research, researchers bear the responsibility of ensuring the protection of the privacy rights of the individuals participating in their studies. In addition, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe requires researchers affiliated with any institution within the European Economic Area (EEA) to protect the privacy of research participants if they handle personal data in their research. In this context, the more personal data are collected, the greater the need for data de-identification.


<div class="pink-box">

This guide provides practical guidance on pseudonymizing and anonymizing personal data in research- the two data de-identification approaches. It includes examples of various techniques for different types of research data and is structured as follows:

•	In **Chapter 2**, the term "personal data" is defined.

•	In **Chapter 3**, the principle of data minimisation is introduced.

•	In **Chapter 4**, the concepts of data pseudonymisation and anonymisation are explained.

•	In **Chapter 5**, the pseudonymization and anonymisation techniques for different types of research data, mainly textual data, numerical data, audio and visual data and spatial data are discussed. Practical examples regarding these types of data are given.

•	In **Chapter 6**, the guide concludes with some practical considerations.
