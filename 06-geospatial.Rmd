# Geospatial data {#geospatial}

This section presents examples of the techniques commonly used for de-identifying geospatial data. 

Geospatial data refer to information linked to specific geographic locations. Geospatial data are often used in research for analysis, visualisation, and understanding of relationships and patterns within a geographic context. Geospatial data anonymisation involves techniques that reduce spatial or temporal resolution, i.e., the precision or scale at which data is captured (e.g., exact GPS coordinates vs. general area), and granularity, i.e., the level of detail in data attributes (e.g., full address vs. city name). Commonly used techniques to anonymise geospatial data include spatial aggregation, attribute anonymisation, and spatial displacement. 

**Spatial aggregation **
The aggregation technique helps mask the exact locations while preserving overall spatial patterns and trends. It can take two forms: 

The first form is known as **area aggregation**, which involves reducing the level of detail by summarising spatial details (the location of a household or a hospital) into larger spatial units, such as zip codes, cities, census blocks or any other large administration or geographic units.

```

The second form is **point aggregation**, which is assigning multiple individual records to one geographic coordinate. Examples include a population dot map where one dot represents 100 persons (see Figure 15).  

**Attributes anonymisation** 

The technique involves deleting or modifying any attribute or variable that could identify or link to individuals. Attributes such as the coordinates of households, exact locations of rare diseases, cadastral boundaries, ages, income, crime incidences, etc. can be deleted or modified similarly to numerical or textual data, as described in the previous sections. 

**Spatial displacement/adjusting spatial coordinates **

Spatial displacement is a technique that involves shifting spatial data points (coordinates) to a different location within a specific range or distance by, for example, adding or subtracting a fixed or random number to both the x-axis and the y-axis. 

Spatial displacement preserves the spatial distribution and density of your data while making it difficult to pinpoint the exact original location of each point. It involves altering data accuracy to weaken links between the data and the individuals. This would mean that a map feature, for example, a point, is displaced to a new location (d-distance) away from its original location. 

**Figure 16:** The original coordinates of the University of Twente on Google Maps (52.24001648578193, 6.849739376582042) are displaced to new random coordinates (52.245130, 6.837690) at a given distance
