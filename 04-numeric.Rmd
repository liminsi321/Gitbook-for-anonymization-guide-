# Numerical data

Numerical data consists of numbers and is commonly  organized in a table with rows and columns. Rows represent observations or attributes of each data subject, while columns display values for various variables—attributes of interest to researchers.

## Generalisation

Generalization techniques reduce the granularity of the attributes/records in the data. It can be performed by：
 
(1) **Categorising personal identifiers.** For example, age is replaced by an age category or range. Geographic units formed by combining all ZIP codes with the same four initial digits contains more than 20000 people. 

(2) **Top and bottom coding of the upper or lower ranges.** Very high and low values are grouped into categories to minimize identifiability due to outliers. For example, ages above or below certain limits are classified as groups to prevent the identification of exceptionally older or younger individuals. A top code of “X or more” could be applied to avoid identifying older subjects. 

(3) **Collapsing and/or combining variables.** Merging data recorded in two or more variables into a single category. This is particularly useful if the initial data collection creates several categories with very few subjects in each. 

(4) **Perturbation can be used where small changes in value are acceptable.** This technique can be used where small changes in value are acceptable. This technique involves rounding, adding noise, or replacing real values with simulation values. It should not be used when data accuracy is critical. 


```{r numeric_generalization,fig.align='center',fig.width=10, fig.height=7, out.width="80%", echo=FALSE}
  knitr::include_graphics("figure/numeric_generalization.png") 
```



**Rounding**

It returns a number rounded to a base number to prevent exact matching with external data sources (https://sdcpractice.readthedocs.io/en/latest/anon_methods.html#special-case-census-data). It can be used to deal with data like age, height, weight, or house number. Examples of rounding are demonstrated with tools such as Excel, R, or Python.

```{r rounding,fig.align='center',fig.width=10, fig.height=7, out.width="80%", echo=FALSE}
  knitr::include_graphics("figure/rounding.png") 
```

**Noise addition**

This technique adds or subtracts the original values with a random number. Larger random numbers result in higher levels of noise. Note that the results of noise addition are irreversible because each modification introduces randomness to the original values.

This technique can be used for a few values, such as outliers, or for the entire dataset. When handling data with continuous values, the distribution of continuous data should be preserved to maintain more information in the datasets. Examples can be found in the table below.


```{r noise_addition,fig.align='center',fig.width=10, fig.height=7, out.width="80%", echo=FALSE}
  knitr::include_graphics("figure/noise_addition.png") 
```



## Suppression

Suppression involves deleting the identifying information from the data. Some attributes (variables) or records (observations) can be removed in certain cases to make the identifier not unique anymore. This is, for example, in the case of outliers that can easily allow the re-identification of an individual. 

## Swapping

This technique is also known as shuffling or permutation and involves rearranging the attributes of data subjects in a dataset.

When each data subject has attributes which are stored in the columns in a spreadsheet, the attributes of every two randomly selected data subjects can be swapped.  until all data subjects have been covered. In this way, the distribution of attributes would not be changed while each data subject’s attributes are altered. For example, if you collect each data subject's, job title and income, swapping the job titles among subjects reduces the likelihood of identifying an individual through both their job titles and Income.

In this way, the distribution of attributes would not be changed while each data subject’s attributes are altered.

Note: This technique should not be used where the data has been collected to study relationships of attributes of same data subjects.

## Masking numemral data

Masking numerical data involves replacing entirely or partially numbers with a special symbol (such as '*' or 'x') in the same way words are replaced in textual data. 

See the table below for examples.


```{r mask_numeric,fig.align='center',fig.width=10, fig.height=7, out.width="90%", echo=FALSE}
  knitr::include_graphics("figure/mask_numeric.png") 
```
