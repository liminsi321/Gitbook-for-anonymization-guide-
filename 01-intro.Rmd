# What is personal data? {#personal_data}

The term "Personal data" refers to any information that enables you to identify a living person. According to the GDPR,  a living person can be identified, directly or indirectly, by means of an identifier such as a name, a citizen identification number, location data, or by other information specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that living person.

<div class="three-column-container">
  <div class="three-column">**Direct identifiers**  
    Information unique to an individual can directly identify that person.
  </div>
  <div class="three-column">**Strong indirect identifiers**  
    Information that can easily identify an individual, such as a rare event, uncommon disease, unique job title, or IP address.
  </div>
  <div class="three-column">**Indirect identifiers**  
    Information that, when combined with other data, can identify an individual, such as address, age, gender, occupation, location, health records, or ethnic group.
  </div>
</div>

It is worth noting that some identifiers are particularly considered **strong indirect identifiers** because they can significantly increase the risk of identifying an individual when combined with other information. Examples of strong identifiers include a date of birth,  an IP address etc.
