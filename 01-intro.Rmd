# What is personal data? {#personal_data}

The term "Personal data" refers to any information that enables you to identify a living person. According to the GDPR,  a living person can be identified, directly or indirectly, by means of an identifier such as a name, a citizen identification number, location data, or by other information specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that living person.

It is worth noting that some identifiers are particularly considered **strong indirect identifiers** because they can significantly increase the risk of identifying an individual when combined with other information. Examples of strong identifiers include a date of birth,  an IP address etc.

For extensive overview of different types of identifiers, see Table 1.
